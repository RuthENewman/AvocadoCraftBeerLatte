# Avocado, Craft Beer, Latte - https://ruthenewman.github.io/AvocadoCraftBeerLatte/

Day 13 of challenge to build 30 vanilla JS projects over 30 days (rock paper scissors game with a hipster theme)

Users select one of the three options by clicking on the relevant icon, and the score increases based on whether the user has won (+1 for 'you'), the computer (+1 for the 'virtual hipster'), or if both choices are the same (+1 for both).

As this is currently a front-end project only, the scores reset on refresh.

A single-page vanilla JS web application with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css). 
The directory also includes a sub-directory of image files (free icons from https://www.shareicon.net/) and sounds 
(from https://www.freesound.org, specifcially from the pack https://freesound.org/people/rhodesmas/packs/17958/ by Andy Rhode).

# Disclaimer
The hipster theme is meant in jest only!
